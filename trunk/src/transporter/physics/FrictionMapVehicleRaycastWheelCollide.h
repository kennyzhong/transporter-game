	// ground friction calculation for raycast vehicles. Here, as a very simple example, we overwrite the friction to be
	// 0.01 for all bodies (upon which we are driving) which have been tagged with a VEHICLE_RAYCAST_FRICTION_PROPERTY
	// user property, otherwise we leave the friction as it is.
	// In general of course, the friction value need not be constant over the body (or time), and any function can be used 
	// here, for example a lookup into your own full 2D 'friction map'.
	// Other ways to store/retrieve friction values would be via:
	//	hkpShape user data
	//	A 'float' hkpProperty stored with a the rigid body
	//	hkMeshMaterials for hkMeshShapes
